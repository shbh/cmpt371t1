**Participants:**

> _**Experienced users:**_ Computer science students/engineering students/gamer students

> With these users we will receive technical, development specific feedback.

> _**Inexperienced users:**_ Arts students/Anonymous

> With these users we will receive our target demographic usability feedback.

**Groups:**

  * a) Control group ( 5 experienced people)

  * b) Experiment group ( 5 experienced people)

  * c) Control group ( 5 inexperienced  people )

  * d) Experiment group ( 5 inexperienced people )

**Implementation Plan:**

> Phase 1:

> Every member finds 2 experienced people to test our game

> Groups a) and b) are tested

> Phase 2:

> Test team goes to crowded place in campus finds inexperienced persons

> Groups c) and d) are tested

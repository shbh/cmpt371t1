# Introduction #

Our coding conventions for this project.  Much of it will follow the Java coding conventions with some small modifications.

A great site which references the style is (even comes with a checkstyle script for the style):

The only modification I will make to the style above so far is private variable naming.  They suggest private String foo`_`.  I do enjoy the underscore but not its position.  private String `_`foo.  That way all class privates can be found by starting with "_", this helps auto complete in the IDE._

Will fill this in later in full.  For now reference the site above.

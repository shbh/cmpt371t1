# Introduction #
This is extra incentive for people to come to meetings.
This will be recording on each meeting, who has come and who has not.
By decree of our Fearless Leader, the person who has the most absents will become our designated Coffee Grimalkin (Please use Google).

What this means is that that person will basically become our maid.

Coffee Grimalkin Duties:
> Must get coffee from Tim Hortons on every meeting.

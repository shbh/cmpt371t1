Test Case (6): Stress test

Purpose: To test and verify that is able to cope under stranious conditions

Prereq: Map is started

Test Data:

    (post map grid here) 

Steps:

    User starts game
        Android's Luminance memory is reduced 
    User chooses first level play through tutorial
        Android slowly reduces memory for Luminance to 0
            Luminance system realizes memory is too low returns error exits 
        Android's Luminance memory is reset to normal
        Android's hard drive space is set to very low 
    User starts game
    User chooses first level play through tutorial
        Luminance gives error hard drive space is too low

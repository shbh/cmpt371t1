Test Case (6): Stress test

Purpose: To test and verify that is able to cope under stranious conditions

Prereq: Map is started

Test Data:

    (post map grid here) 

Steps:

    User starts game
        Android's Luminance memory is reduced 
    User chooses first level play through tutorial
        Android slowly reduces memory for Luminance to 0
            Luminance system realizes memory is too low returns error exits 
        Android's Luminance memory is reset to normal
        Android's hard drive space is set to very low 
    User starts game

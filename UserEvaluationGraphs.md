This section of graphs is to represent the individual ratings users gave each area of the game.

The horizontal axis represents the ranking from 1 to 10 the users gave each aspect of the game.  The vertical axis represents the number of votes counted for each ranking.

The significant thing to notice here is that with all the game aspect, response was quite positive.

## Audio ##
This game aspect includes what the user thought of the music and sound effects.

# Overall Game Ratings #
This graph represents how users felt about the game overall, just as a game.

Real Game Rating represents the ranking the users gave the game if they looked at it from the point of view as though it were a game already on the market.

Development Game Rating represents how the user thought of the game if they looked at it as though it were a game in development; which it was.  These rankings were slightly higher, which makes sense.

Overall Game Rating is simply the average of the previous two.

# Improvements and Dislikes #
This graph represents the suggestions the user gave when asked what could be improved in the game, in comparison to things they disliked about the game.

These two things were put on the same graph due to their similarity in nature.  However, they do differ slightly in the sense that suggestions for improvement may not necessarily mean the user disliked it.  However, they are similar in the sense that anything the user dislikes is a suggestion for improvement.

As it can be seen, responsive controls (i.e. input) was the biggest dislike of the game, as well as quite a high topic for suggestion for improvement.  This has been taken into account and has since been improved.

# User Suggestions #
This graph was made out of the suggestions users game up with when asked what new features they would like to see in the game.

We have accomplished the suggestions for level select, in-game instructions, and more levels.  We also do have a level editor, though it is not made for users and is just for our purposes.  It would be nice to be able to include it in a future version of the game.

We alleviated the issue of a bigger grid by allowing and improving the zoom functionality.

As for scoreboard/points/achievements and new tools, these are things we wished to implement, but did not have time.

As for own music - meaning allowing the user to listen to their own music while playing - it is an interesting thought, and not one we thought of before.  It may be a good idea to include in a future version.

# Likability #
This graph simply represents that most people like puzzle games, which is the type of game we made.  It also shows that most people liked this game.  This shows that we achieved the goal of pleasing our user audience.

# Bugs and Defects #
This graph represents the answers we got when the user was asked if they found any bugs or defects.  As it can be seen, 59% did not report any bugs, which was pleasing to see.  As for the other 41%, their suggestions weren't so much bugs, per say, but suggestions for improvement once again.

As it can be seen, input took quite a hit here.  As mentioned above, this has been taken into account and improved as much as we could.

Orientation change was in fact a little buggy when we did user evaluations.  This small of a number for a known bug is a little surprising, but may also suggest that not all users tried the orientation change.  Regardless, we have done our best to make this work as well.

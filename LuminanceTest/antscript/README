What it does:
	Updates build.xml of both test and project
	Compiles both projects
	Installs both projects
	Runs the emulator
	Runs the standard -run-tests
		That does not run the tests made

What it doesn't do:
	Run the actual tests as of yet
	Dumb targets are not 


What needs to be done:
	Inject the stuff.rtf into build.xml
	Also delete build.xml when finished so that eclipse IDE runs it properly
	Make it call the right package
	Kill ant
	Make it so that I know when the emulator is done loading

stuff.rtf
	Contains teh necessary injection into the test package build.xml so that it runs manually from the command-line

build.xml
	to run test suite
	change the build.properties so that all URL's are pointed correctly in their respective local machines
	from command line
	<ant>
	or 
	<ant run.script>

	all without the < and >

= Introduction =

Will be listing our tasks and now as well as our future plans and Milestone tasks completion based on TestPlan


== Version Control Strategy ==

   The reason LuminanceTestSuite and LuminanceSmokeTest are in two different parts of the svn are as follows:
      * LuminanceTestSuite must be in the same as the main project so that it may be invoked on the eclipse IDE
      * LuminanceSmokeTest is not part of the Main project and, therefore, serves no purpose to be in the same directory and has no need to be invoked by the Eclipse IDE. The Ant script, IDE, Android SDK all trying to change files/links within the SmokeTest and TestSuite somehow affect their paths and was one of the major blockages that held back the implementation of a Smoke Test. This is so that both the SmokeTest and TestSuite are as separate as possible. It will be more work to add core tests from the TestSuite but it will also ensure a clear seperation of what basic testing is compared to a full fledged test suite. Ant and ADB from the android can invoke certain packages, classes, or even methods from the test suite and an ant script is possible to be made that invoke what are supposed to be in a smoke test. But this can give cause to reading a text of an ant script rather than to the possibilites of a nice GUI representation of a SmokeTest, of which, the GUI will be a nice representation of the test as a whole. Also, much better management, even with more work and space consumption. -- Sorry for the rant --

== Updates ==
  === Milestone 2 ===
    
    ==== Notes ====
      * Two members have gone from the team. Chet has agreed to testing. Its now Jeff, Amara, and Chet
      * Jeff is focusing on Smoke Tests, JUnit
      * Amara is focusing on Robotium, Use-case scenarios, User Scenario Play Test
      * Chet is focusing on JUnit
      * Guide on how to get/use LuminanceTestSuite and LuminanceSmokeTest are up on the environment set-up guide
    
    ==== Tasks Completed ====
      * Smoke test ( Three Thumbs Up!)
      * Plan of User-Scenario Test
      * Use-Case Scenarios
      * Template Ready for Use-case scenario to GUI test
      * Start on JUnit Tests
      * Talk with Dr Kevin Stanley
      * Co-operation with Dev established

    ==== Tasks Uncompleted ====
      * Tests not all implemented

    ==== Estimated Time ====
      40 hours
    ==== Actual Time ====
      60 hours (grabbed from member times as of February 18, 2011)

    ===== Comments =====
      Although the tests are not fully implemented, I believe with Amara's scenarios and research into Robotium will help greatly in the coming Milestone 3. Also, with the main smoke test not running, resources (Me and Chet) can fully get into implementing the full suite of tests and will now be maintenance. The estimated time might've been actual if not for the fact of over-estimating the learning curve and integration of the new technologies. As of this Milestone (2); the test team is a little behind in the tests but I believe it shouldn't take more than a day or two of work to get a good coverage of tests, relative to the dev team's work, implemented.

 Since game testing is substantially different from any other software testing, decide between conventional testing vs user hands on testing. Inquire experienced persons(Prof. Stanley, Prof. Osgood) on the best approach to testing game mechanics. Implement ant script on local machine.

  Because the build server does not have Eclipse and teamcity uses ant scripts/builds, I believe these can help us understand how to make an automated smoke test and later, a fully automatic test suite.

  Research testing suites
    * Robotium - UI testing
    * JUnit - Core, smoke test
    * Anything else that you guys might think will be necessary

  If possible, any concept or example of such tests being run (Does not have to use the Luminance
  package) is good.

  Something else to look at is, instead of running eclipse's automatic builds, try and get either ant
  scripting up or command-line build/runs.

  Download eclipse
  Code Coverage: http://update.eclemma.org

  Make a Concept smoke test
  Due: by the end of the week or next meeting.
  
  Create ant script for smoke test,
      * Make it so that it builds a project
      * Upon rejection, don't commit/error
      * Else, run some unit testing/smoke test

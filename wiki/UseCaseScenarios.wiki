*Preconditions*:

   Walkthrough map is created e.g. Luminance video 1:03.

                                    Map rules:

                                                One light beam

                                                3 differing colored circles

                                                At least one wall obstacle impeding direct access to circle

                                                Top wall, bottom wall

                                                A solution

                                                Only 1 prism

                                                Multiple instances of mirrors, based on difficulty

                                                Infinite eraser

                                                Able to change orientation, camera focuses on centre

*Success Guarantee*

The player splits the beam of white light into primary colors and redirects them into the primary colors and redirects them into colored goals using mirrors. Success music plays and the user is given the option menu and their time of completion.

                       

*Main Success Scenario*

            # They open the program
            # The player chooses ->Start Game from main menu
            # Single taps the tools prism
            # Double taps at (6, 4) the prism is placed
            # Single taps the tools mirror
            # Double taps at (8, 4) the mirror is placed
            # Single taps until  M\
            # Single taps the tools mirror
            # Double taps at (8, 5) mirror is placed
            # Single taps the mirror
            # Double tap at (6, 6) mirror placed
            # Single taps until \M
            # Single taps the mirror
            # Double tap at (6, 7) mirror placed
            # Single taps the tools mirror
            # Double tap at (7, 1) mirror placed
            # Single taps until M\
            # First level complete

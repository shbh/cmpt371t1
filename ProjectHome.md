# Luminance - Puzzle Game #

## Description ##
Luminance is a puzzle game originally designed to run on XNA/XBOX360 and written in C#.  The purpose of this project is to rewrite Luminance to Java/OpenGL in order to run on Android phones, and other devices as well.  The goal of the game is to split a beam of white light into the primary colours and redirect them into coloured goals using mirrors.  The game contains a set of pre-made levels and also a random level generator and level editor.

| 14         | level select, level editor | More levels, the ones you have are good | n/a        |
| 15         | level select after completion | level over button i had a hard time clicking on. I woud just move mirrors in background and stuff | n/a        |
| 16         | A quick "how to" for new players | level selection maybe | n/a        |
| 17         | n/a        | change the colour of original lights | n/a        |

| 19         | move levels | bigger squares, less sensitive double tap | n/a        |
| 20         | Make stages with coloured filters, recombining light | find a more intuitive way to show the direction the light is travelling | n/a        |
| 21         | Rewards, achievements | more objects| Game didn't improve the neatness of my writing |
| 22         | High scoring, dragging, timer for points, different prisms, diagonal light | color grid differently| Still pretty fun to play |

| PERSON TO PERSON IMPRESSIONS/SUGGESTIONS |
|:-----------------------------------------|
| Feature                                  | Different background for every level     |
| Reason                                   | Space background was nice, but other colorful/visual bgs wanted|
| Feature                                  | Block different colours than background  |
| Reason                                   | Blocks are not distinguishable from background|
| Feature                                  | singlePress and singleLongPress should provide the same functionality|
| Reason                                   |When the single press fails users tries to push harder and longer, which makes them fail harder(since long press doesn't have any functionality)|
| Feature                                  |More than one song, or ability to play your own songs in the bg |
| Reason                                   |generally everyone thought positively of the music, though might have a little repetitive.|
| Feature                                  |Hints                                     |
| Reason                                   |people may become frustrated and abandon the game|
| Feature                                  | Manual                                   |
| Reason                                   | Manual should be just a list of controls |
| Feature                                  | Discrete zoom in out buttons             |
| Reason                                   | This would get rid of all zooming issues, people have gotten stuck when the zoomed in too much, no way to solve besides resetting game |
